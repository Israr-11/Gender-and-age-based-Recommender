Here's a breakdown of the code and some suggestions for improvement

1. Data Preparation:
The code iterates through the image directory, extracts filenames, splits them to get age and gender labels, loads the images, and converts them to RGB format.
It then converts labels to NumPy arrays and splits the data into training and testing sets for both age and gender prediction (although you only train the age model in this snippet).


2. Model Definition:

The age_model is a Sequential model with several convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer for regression.
You've commented out some additional convolutional layers, which you can experiment with to see if they improve performance.

3. Training:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error (mse) loss function (suitable for regression tasks like age prediction), and mean absolute error (mae) metric.
The model is trained for 100 epochs with validation data to monitor performance on unseen data.

4. Evaluation:
Finally, the trained model is saved as age_model_100epochs.h5.
